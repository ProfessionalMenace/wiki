# Undefined Behavior

Undefined behavior (UB) occurs when you violate rules specified by the language. For example: Reading uninitialized
memory, performing out-of-bounds memory access, or using an object after it no longer exists.

<!-- inline -->

## Example: Indeterminate Value

```cpp
int i; // uninitialized
while(i < 10) {
    printf("%d\n", i++);
}
```

<!-- inline -->

## Example: Out-of-Bounds Access

```cpp
int arr[10];
for(int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    arr[i] = 0;
}
```

## Why it Matters

Compilers often do not give warnings or errors about UB and its existence in your code can cause surprising,
unpredictable, and buggy behavior.
